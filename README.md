The goal is to create the first fully rigged model with an IK Setup made directly in the Godot 4 Engine, inclusive Animations.
This project shall grow bigger, by optimizing the IK System, add other character types (also with rig + IK), and many many animations.

That way, we can hopefully contribute to the Godot Engine and every gamedev working with Godot.

If you want to support this project, do not hesitate to make this IK system better, add animations, create models, etc.

16.05.2023:
Sadly, the IK System ind Godot 4.0 release Version is broken.
I'll wait with doing an update until there is a working system again in Godot 4,... hopefully in version 4.2+
